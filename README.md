# Steps

2) Choose File Type (Jpg, Jpeg, Png, Bmp, Gif, Tif)
3) List All Files in the selected directory
4) Delete Same Files (The application are deleting files exactly the same. I saw some applications that deleting similar files. I think this is not good cause they're not same. Really, two documents has two paragraphs and completely different phrases and topics can delete. That's not good)
